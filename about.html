  <p>Hi! I'm Paige. I'm a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp, looking for a junior dev or apprentice position. I teach and organize for <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/chicago">Girl Develop It Chicago</a>.</p>

  <p>I enjoy patios, talking to strangers on airplanes (sorry, Mom), and the Oxford comma. I daydream about my future french bulldog and will stop you on the street to pet yours if you're out walking one.</p>
