# Paige Crum Portfolio Site

Redesign of my personal site using Jekyll. 

This site uses [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper) (Ghost's default theme) for Jekyll.

To run this site, clone the repo, download the dependencies, and run:
        $ jekyll serve --watch

This starts your local server and tells it to automatically watch for changes you make. (Without the `--watch` flag, you'd have to restart the server to see each change.)

Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
